![Build Status](https://action-badges.now.sh/twbs/icons)

## Install

Bootstrap Icons are packaged up and published to npm. We only include the processed SVGs in this package—it's up to you and your team to implement. [Read our docs](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) at for usage instructions.

```
npm i bootstrap-icons --save
```

## Development

Clone the repo, install dependencies, and start the Hugo server locally.

```
git clone https://github.com/twbs/icons/
cd icons
npm i
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser.

## Adding SVGs

Once a new SVG icon has been added to the `icons` directory, you'll need to prep and build them. Two npm scripts are used to optimize and modify the HTML source code of our SVGs.

1. `npm run icons-prep` runs SVGO on our SVGs.
2. `npm run icons-build` processes the HTML, removes all attributes, and then sets new attributes and values in a particular order.

Use `npm run icons` to run them in order, then commit the results in a new branch for updating.

## Publishing

Docs are published via an npm script that builds the Hugo site, creates a temporary Git repo, and force pushes that to our `gh-pages` branch. This circumvents issues with GitHub Pages not working with Hugo.

```
npm run publish
```
